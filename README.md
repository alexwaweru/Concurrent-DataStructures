# Concurrent Data Structures implemented in C

This project is about implementation of concurrent data structures in C Programming language.

## Requirements & Concepts:

- Multi-threading: implemented using pthread.h 
- Mutex locks: implemented using pthread.h
- Understanding of C structures
- Understanding of C pointers
 
## Note:

- Header files contains the implemented data structures. 
- <data_structure-test>.c files contains the tests for the various data structures
## Compile:
```console
gcc -o <binary filename> <file to compile> -lpthread
```
### Run:
```console
./<compiled binary file>
```
